<p>Hi, i&#39;m Emiliano &quot;Pixu&quot; Pisu.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a &quot;vintage&quot; developer who loves to code and to share ideas, thoughts, knowledge.</p>
<p>I&#39;m starting this blog to talk and discuss about web-based technology, honestly most of times i&#39;ll focus in UI/UX, because i love it.</p>
<p>However, in order to be able to talk about User Interaction, we&#39;ll need to discuss about:</p>
<ul>
<li>core web technologies</li>
<li>cross browser compatibility (thanks for your time IE butâ€¦ no thanks!!! ðŸ¤£)</li>
<li>a11y</li>
<li>performances</li>
<li>best practices</li>
<li>responsiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s start a new trip together in the world HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
