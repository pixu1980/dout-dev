# Building DoUt.Dev

Welcome to my feather light Blog + CMS Creation Development Notes

## Development Notes

It's almost two year I decided to build a Developer Blog for Developers

### Assumptions

- writing articles in markdown
- 0 dependencies
- no-weight/lightweight js code-base
- system and user preferences related css codebase
- ...

### Design System

An awesome Designer, a friend of mine, `Ramona De Berardiniis`, started by designing the first version of the blog.
That version never seen the light, my bad! But served as case study for me to figure out what I wanted to do.

Recently the awesome UI/UX Designer/Engineer, another friend of mine, `Arianna Vico`, built with Figma an upgraded version of my ideas with a small styling guide.

Then I stepped into the `system.css` ... the browser indeed is already a design system

#### Typography

Once I built an interesting talk about Typography, with the friendship of Alberto Angeli, a I got really sensible to the topic.

I spent a log of time thinking about the typography I wanted to achieve for my blog, finally decided to use system-ui and monospace fonts, for two main reasons:

- no other font to prefetch/load except the icons
-

### Template, UI, UX
