## Welcome to dout.dev

Hi, i'm Emiliano "Pixu" Pisu.

I'm a "vintage" developer who loves to code and to share ideas, thoughts, knowledge.

I'm starting this blog to talk and discuss about web-based technology, honestly most of times i'll focus in UI/UX, because i love it.

However, in order to be able to talk about User Interaction, we'll need to discuss about:
- core web technologies
- cross browser compatibility (thanks for your time IE butâ€¦ no thanks!!! ðŸ¤£)
- a11y
- performances
- best practices
- responsiveness

Let's start a new trip together in the world HTML, CSS and JS.
